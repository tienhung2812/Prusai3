# Summary

Yet another earbud holder. Not like we have enough of those here on Thingiverse, right? Well, I wanted something a bit different from the designs already available. Specifically I wanted the whole thing to be somewhat enclosed and able to take a beating. I think I've reached those goals.  
As a bonus it has a very satisfying clack sound when you close it up ;)

# Instructions

UPDATE 2012-12-18: Just a random tip. I've seen that those of you who have been nice enough to post pictures of your prints (Please keep doing that, it makes me happy :) ) are wrapping your cables all the way from bud to plug. What I do is fold the cord in half so that the plug and buds are next to each other. Stuff the buds and plug into the cavity and then wrap up the cord. That will save you time.  
UPDATE 2012-12-05: A few people reported issues with the STLs that prevented them from being properly sliced in slic3r. I have uploaded repaired STLs that should work better. Please use the STLs that end with "_repaired". I'll keep the old files around for a while just in case these new ones present other issues. Sorry about the troubles this may have caused.  
The core can be printed without support without issues. If you have trouble getting it to stick to the bed try printing it upside down, the overhang will be a bit worse but will probably print ok with good cooling.  
The shells however needs a bit of support for the nubs, rough/medium support in KISSlicer worked well for me, took under a minute to clean up. Either print individually or use the plate to print both at once.  
To assemble simply force the shells over the core until they snap into place. Print the shells fairly solid so that they don't break on assembly. To minimize the risk of breaking do not pull at the protruding tabs, instead grab it like shown in the picture with the green arrow.  
This copy was printed on an Ultimaker for those curious.
