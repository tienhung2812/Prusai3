This is a hard to print testfile!   
often you don't know if your printer is ready for complex files. with this file you have an easy option to check problematic printing/slicing stuff.  

does your printer challenge this ultimative part?   
check it out and get (almost) instant results.  

these test are included in this tiny file:  

- size: the object is 4x50x50mm (baseplate)  
- hole size: 3 holes (3/4/5mm)  
- Nut size: M4 Nut should fit perfectly  
- fine details: pyramide, cone, all numbers  
- rounded print: wave, half sphere  
- minimum distance between walls: 0.1/0.2/0.3/0.4/0.5mm  
- overhang: 25°/30°/35°/40°/45°  
- bridge print: 2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9mm  
- surface: all the flat parts  

there could be a lot of things go wrong, here the most common ones  
- your printbed is not leveled (should be better than layerheigth you're printing, e.g use a Micrometre)  
- your axis (Y/X/Z) clearence (with higher speed you also get problems with the moving mass)  
- your slicer and configuration (every slicer handles things different and could contain bugs)  
- retract settings (not correctly set you will see blobs or holes on every retract position)  
- to high temperature (small details will get overheated)  
- to reach this time, your printer should run between 60-200mm/s, infill as fast as possible. not every printer works in this range, so try to figure out where you're printer limit is.  
- text is hard to read > use a smaller nozzle/other slicer  


# Instructions

infill: 33% infill or similar  
layerheight: choose the smallest possible layerheight. optimal 0.1mm or lower  
print time: about 50 minutes, depending on your printer & settings. ) to reach this time, your printer should run between 60-200mm/s)  
raft; you can use a raft
